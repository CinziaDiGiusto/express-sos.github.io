*** 1st CALL FOR PAPERS EXPRESS/SOS@CONFEST2024
Combined
31st International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency
and 21st Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics
(EXPRESS/SOS 2024)

https://express-sos.github.io/

Calgary (Canada)
September 9, 2024, Affiliated with CONCUR 2024

Submission deadline (full and short papers):
Monday, June 24, 2024
===========================================

== SCOPE AND TOPICS
The EXPRESS/SOS workshop series aims at bringing together researchers
interested in the formal semantics of systems and programming
concepts, and in the expressiveness of computational models.

Topics of interest for EXPRESS/SOS 2024 include, but are not limited to:

- expressiveness and rigorous comparisons between models of
computation (process algebras, event structures, Petri nets, rewrite
systems)
- expressiveness and rigorous comparisons between programming
languages and models (distributed, component-based, object-oriented,
service-oriented);
- logics for concurrency (modal logics, probabilistic and stochastic
logics, temporal logics and resource logics);
- analysis techniques for concurrent systems;
- theory of structural operational semantics (meta-theory,
category-theoretic approaches, congruence results);
- comparisons between structural operational semantics and other
formal semantic approaches;
- applications and case studies of structural operational semantics;
- software tools that automate, or are based on, structural
operational semantics.

We especially welcome contributions bridging the gap between the above
topics and neighbouring areas, such as, for instance:
- computer security
- multi-agent systems
- programming languages
- formal verification
- reversible computation
- knowledge representation


== SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:
We invite two types of submissions:
* Full papers (up to 15 pages, excluding references).
* Short papers (up to 5 pages, excluding references, not included in
the workshop post-proceedings)

All submissions have to adhere to the EPTCS format (https://info.eptcs.org/).
Simultaneous submission to journals, conferences or other workshops is
only allowed for short papers; full papers must be unpublished.

Submission is performed through EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=expresssos2024

The final versions of accepted full papers will be published in EPTCS.
It is understood that for each accepted submission one of the
co-authors will register for the workshop and give the talk.

* We are pleased to announce the possibility of a Joint Special Issue with EXPRESS/SOS 2023 (due in December 2024).
