*** Invitation speakers EXPRESS/SOS@CONCUR 2023 

Dear ***,

EXPRESS/SOS 2024 - Combined 31st International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and 21st Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics will be held in Calgary, Canada on September 9 (affiliated with CONCUR 2024). 

WEB: https://express-sos.github.io/

Our aim is to bring together researchers interested in the formal semantics of systems and programming concepts, and in the expressiveness of computational models. We hope EXPRESS/SOS 2023 will provide the perfect setting to get acquainted with the latest developments and trends in the field, to address existing gaps and improvements along this line of research, and facilitate the exchange of technical expertise, supported by lively and interactive discussions.

We would be thankful if you could let us know by *April 15, 2024* whether you accept our invitation. If so, we would be thankful if we could also receive a title and a short abstract.

Furthermore, if you please, we would like to invite you submit a paper based on your talk.

As the meeting will take place as an event of CONCUR 2024 you might consider extending your participation to the main conference program and other complementing workshops.

Looking forward to receiving your reply, kind regards 

â€“ Cinzia and Georgiana (EXPRESS/SOS 2024 Organising Committee)
