*** Invitation white paper EXPRESS/SOS@CONCUR2023

Dear ***,

This year's edition of the EXPRESS/SOS workshop will mark two important anniversaries: EXPRESS will turn 30 and SOS will turn 20!

It is our pleasure to invite you contribute with a position/white paper including your reflection on the current/future promising research challenges related to expressiveness and SOS. It can be a short paper on your thoughts & memories about the topic (e.g, 4-5 pages) or a longer one (15 pages). This would be up to you.

This kind of contribution will be included in the EPTCS official workshop proceedings. 

It would be fantastic if you accepted and made this anniversary remarkable.

Please, do not hesitate to contact us for further details.

Thank you in advance, and look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
Georgiana and Claudio
